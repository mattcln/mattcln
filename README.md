- 👋 Hi, I’m Matthieu Colin
- 👀 I’m interested in data in general: from business analysis to specific ML models
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build and deploy pipelines & models and how to write clean and easily replicated code
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on positive impact projects (social, medical or environmental), Open Source preferred. (e.g. Data For Good)
